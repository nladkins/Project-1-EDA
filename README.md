# Project-1-EDA

This repository reflects the effort of a group project where we analyzed both CDC and Stanford University data regarding COVID-19.  We specifically 
focused on how COVID-19 impacted the habits of individuals with pre-existing conditions who are more vulnerable to negative outcomes from the virus.  
The Stanford Data includes separate surveys taken evaluating individual's physical well being, communication, and mental health well being before and 
during COVID.  This data was not consistent with best practices such as using "0" for "No" responses, etc., so a lot of work was done to scrub the data 
and approach the work from multiple angles.  Therefore, the repository includes a number of data frames and code that focused on the filtering of data, 
dropping null responses, dropping incomplete surveys, etc.  There is a PowerPoint included that provides the results of this analysis.  

To accomplish this work, the team developed the subject repository as well as a sandbox branch to "play" in.  The major pieces of code and data frames 
were pulled into the main branch.  The main branch includes data frames that were generated, visual outputs that were developed etc.
