# Project-1-EDA

This repository reflects the effort of a group project where we analyzed both CDC and Stanford University data regarding COVID-19.  We specifically focused on how COVID-19 impacted the habits of individuals with pre-existing conditions who are more vulnerable to negative outcomes from the virus.  The Stanford Data includes separate surveys taken evaluating individual's physical well being, communication, and mental health well being before and during COVID.  A .txt file includes the research questions that the team prepared.  

The structure of data provided as a result of the survey, particularly the Stanford data, was not consistent with best practices such as using "0" for "No" responses, etc.  A lot of paths were taken to clean the data and approach the work from multiple angles.  Therefore, the repository includes a number of data frames and code that focused on the filtering of data, dropping null responses, dropping incomplete surveys, etc.  There is a PowerPoint included that provides the results of this analysis.  

To accomplish this work, the team developed the subject repository as well as a sandbox branch to "play" in.  The major pieces of code and data frames were pulled into the main branch.  The main branch includes data frames that were generated, visual outputs that were developed etc.  Code files are named in a way to describe the work that took place within that particular set of code.  There is also a powerpoint on the main branch that reflects the work that the team reported out.  

NOTE:  Cleanup was done post presentation, so code may need to be pointed to csv files that were read by the code.
