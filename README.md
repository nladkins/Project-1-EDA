# Project-1-EDA

Hey, y'all.
I added all the work I did last night into the main branch.

The data folder contains all of the stuff I made and have been using (the csv files, the excel files, etc.)

I also uploaded two of the scripts I wrote.
fcns.py is where I'm going to write all my functions. It's there so that we can all use it and write new functions in as needed.

prep_work.py is just the code I wrote to start manipulating data and whatnot. I added it just to show y'all how I went about doing everything.

NLA:  The work I have done is loaded in the "Sandbox" branch.  I did not want to commit anything to main, so I have been committing data there.  Work in progress.
