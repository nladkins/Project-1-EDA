Project Title:  COVIDâ€™s effects on socially beneficial behavior outcomes

Team Members:  Dan Herfurth, Kristen Hanold, Ty Pleasant, Norman Adkins

Project Description:  Assessing available data to determine how certain socially beneficial behaviors were influenced by the COVID-19 outbreak

Research Questions:

    1. How do comorbidities affect lifestyle changes during COVID-19?
    2. How education and socioeconomic status affected worrying about comorbidities?
    3. Did COVID-19 influence changes in pre-existing health conditions before and during the pandemic?

Potential datasets to be used:

    1. Stanford University
    2. U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
    3. UK Office of National Statistics
    4. Johns Hopkins
    5. Others may be identified at a later time.

Rough breakdown of tasks:

    1. Identify the data sources
    2. Clean the data we want to use
    3. Break down the flow of what we want the code to perform addressing our research question
    4. Break this into 3-4 branches, if appropriate
    5. Build the code including visualizations to help narrow our focus
    6. Interpret our findings
    7. Report our findings
